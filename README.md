Project Description: File Upload Page

This project implements a web page that enables users to upload files. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and submitting a CSV file. Upon submission, the CSV file is parsed and processed to suit specific requirements.

Features:
- HTML and CSS-based user interface for file selection and submission
- Utilizes JavaScript to handle file selection, display the selected file name, and submit the file
- Integrates Papa Parse library for parsing CSV data on the client-side
- Backend server (Node.js and Express) to receive and process the uploaded file
- Demonstrates basic file handling on the server-side, including logging the file path and original name

Usage:
1. Open the web page and select a CSV file.
2. Click the "Upload" button to submit the file.
3. The file is parsed and processed, with the file path and original name logged on the server.

This project serves as a foundation for building file upload functionality and handling CSV data. It can be extended to support additional features, such as data validation, database integration, or further processing of the uploaded file.
